    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes come out super fluffy and the whole family loves them. Add as many chocolate chips as you like. Can easily be doubled or tripled. Serve with maple syrup if you like.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> ¾ cup milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>½ cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
                <li>cooking spray </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour" the milk. You are essentially making your own buttermilk with this step.</li>
                <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
            </ol>
